# Overwatch-Genji-Dodgeball-Multi-Teams
**Current Version: v7.6.0**  
**Multi-Teams Code: S0NY9**  

Genji Dodgeball is a minigame inspired by the TF2 game pyro dodgeball.
When the ball is red it is targeting you! Use your deflect to target someone else. Look at the person you want to target next while deflecting. Use bouncepads to get extra air and style points.  
This repository is exclusively for hosting multi-teams, a mode where there can be up to 6 teams against eachother. For the main game the repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/Mazawrath/Overwatch-Genji-Dodgeball)

## A personal note
I am the so called founder of this game, although many names have influenced this game, and I am very proud of that.
I have done 100% of the development of this game for free and I will always do it for free. Please do not be pressured to donate, this is only for if you want to go above and beyond. But if you appreciate what I create, and have funds to spare, I will greatly appreciate any amount that you give, and I will be truly thankful, from the bottom of my heart.
